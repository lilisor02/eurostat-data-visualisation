## What is it?

Application using a Eurostat REST API, that shows a graphical evolution of an indicator and a country selected by the user using a histogram. The available data is displayed as a table for a year selected by the user.

## Why is it?

I wanted to improve my JavaScript knowledge toolbox and this project seemed like the one to do this.

## Challenges

It was my first time building an application that uses a REST API and I had to learn everything from scratch.

## Technologies used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
